Tags: International, consortium

## Brief overview of the situation

Many institutions are cooperating on a large project, spread across the world. The data in question contains personal information (audio recording and transcripts). 

## Key challenges from a RDM perspective

Personal data transfers are problematic from a privacy perspective and should only be performed when necessary.

## Recommendations

Split the work, share anonymized data.
